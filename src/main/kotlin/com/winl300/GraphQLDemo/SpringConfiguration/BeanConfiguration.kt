/**
 * The purpose of this class is to provide a central point for the initializing of all beans for this demo project.
 *    In larger projects, this would be separated into various configuration files that would then be initialized by the
 *    top-level spring configuration file, but that would be overkill for a small demo project of this size.
 *    So, for readability's sake, I have placed them all in one file.
