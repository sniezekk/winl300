###Project Name: 
GraphQL Demo For WINL300
###Project Purpose: 
This demo project explores how to use the Netflix DGS framework of GraphQL within the Spring-Boot framework.
###Project Description:
This project will mimic a queryable endpoint for storing, fetching, and mutating data about people. The goal is not to 
replicate a database, but to simulate the interface of a microservice between the database layer and the UI in a 
microservice architecture environment.
